Dear 2014 Pool Applicant,

You are receiving this email as a result of a system error that has occurred with our payment processor for your 2014 Pool Membership application. It has come to our attention that our payment processing provider incorrectly charged you the 2013 membership rates instead of the adjusted 2014 rates.  This resulted in a charge for an amount that is lower than the full fee required for membership for the summer 2014 season.  As a result, we need to collect the remaining balance due for the 2014 pool membership fees prior to approving your application.

Please find below a link we have provided to you for remitting your remaining balance.  If you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact the Main Office at 703-536-9656 ext. 310 or email Nick Beirne at operations@columbusclubevents.com.

Thank you for your patience in this process and we hope you enjoy the Knights of Columbus Swimming Pools this summer!

See you at the pool!


Thanks,
