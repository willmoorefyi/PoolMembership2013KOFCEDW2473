Fix errors in JSP validation that mark the entire project as in error.

Refactor modal dialog boxes into a single tag and invoke the tag rather than copy/pasting code
refactor memberOptionsTabs to be a taglib, so we can pass object parameters, per http://onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2004/05/12/jsp2part4.html
fix usage of table in membership-form.jspx (use divs / bootstrap)
refactor Member to split into a person (Member) and an application status

reduce copy-paste code between javascript page files
Improve hard-coded "SUCCESS" and "FAIL" statuses returned to JSP pages from controller to more generic handler (client and server-side).

Figure out why the JPA queries don't work for MemberRepository
